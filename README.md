# Distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA)

Method used in Jardim de Queiroz, L. et al. (2017) Multifactorial genetic divergence processes drive the onset of speciation in an Amazonian fish. Plos One. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189349

In this example, db-RDA was used as an approach to investigate potential mechanisms leading to intra-specific diversification in a landscape genetics framework.
The idea was to test for correlations between genetic distance and geographical/environmental variables, such as geographical distance (driving isolation-by-distance), waterfalls ( isolation-by-barrier), and other environmental characteristics (isolation-by-environment).

db-RDA is an alternative to Mantel test, multiple regression anaylsis and other other methods involving distance-based matrices.
